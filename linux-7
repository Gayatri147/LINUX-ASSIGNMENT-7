The general syntax is:
ls<options><directory>
For example,if you want to list all the files in the example directory,then the command will be as follows:
ls example/
There are different options that can be used with the ls command.These options give additional information about the file/folder
-l   lists long format
-a   lists all files including hidden files
-i   lists files with their inode number
-s   lists files with their size and sorts the list
-t   sorts the listed files by time and date

Run the ls -Q command to add quotation marks to all directories and files

A Linux distribution -- often shortened to "Linux distro" -- is a version of the open source Linux operating system that is packaged with other components, such as an installation programs, management tools and additional software such as the KVM hypervisor.
Linux distributions, which are based on the Linux kernel, are often easier for users to deploy than the traditional open source version of Linux. This is because most distributions eliminate the need for users to manually compile a complete Linux operating system from source code, and because they are often supported by a specific vendor.
Generally, Linux distributions consist of what are called software packages. These packages contain specific files, applications or services. For example, a package could be a collection of fonts, web browsers or development environments. A single Linux distribution could contain thousands of software packages. In practical terms, however, Linux distros tend to minimize the number of components and modules to tailor the distro and shrink the operating system's total footprint -- especially if the distro will be deployed in a virtualized environment where many concurrent instances put compute resources at a premium.

sudo (Super User DO) command in Linux is generally used as a prefix of some command that only superuser are allowed to run. If you prefix “sudo” with any command, it will run that command with elevated privileges or in other words allow a user with proper permissions to execute a command as another user, such as the superuser. This is the equivalent of “run as administrator” option in Windows. The option of sudo lets us have multiple administrators. 
sudo -V | -h | -l | -v | -k | -K | -s | [ -H ] [-P ] [-S ] [ -b ] | 
[ -p prompt ] [ -c class|- ] [ -a auth_type ] [-r role ] [-t type ] 
[ -u username|#uid ] commandsudo -V | -h | -l | -L | -v | -k | -K | -s | [ -H ] [-P ] [-S ] [ -b ] |
